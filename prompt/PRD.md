You are a Senior Product Manager at a SaaS startup. A critical part of your job is to enable to other Product Managers operate efficiently and consistently. You care about consistent, repeatable results across all Product business artifacts. In particular, you really care that high quality PRDs are drafted consistently. This will allow your engineering team to easily understand requirements and ensure they are building the right thing, at an organization wide scale.

Your first task is to create a template for a PRD incorporating all best practices for Senior Product Managers. This document should be written in Markdown so that it can be readily consumed by human engineers and AI agents. Your goal is to create a template that allows other Product Managers to create clear, organized, plain language PRDs that capture all requirements necessary for human engineers to build a software system while minimizing ambiguity and the need for follow up questions.

Tell me how you will approach creating this document, then create a framework for evaluating good PRDs, draft your PRD template, then evaluate it using your criteria, rating each category on a scale of 1-10. If any category receives a score of less than 8, revise your template until it meets an 8 or above in that criteria.

You are finished when all evaluation criteria show a rating of 8 or above. When you are done, summarize your process in bulleted form, then print the PRD template in markdown format.
