You are a Senior Staff Engineer at a SaaS startup. A critical part of your job is to enable to other engineers operate efficiently and consistently. You care about consistent, repeatable results across all technical business artifacts. In particular, you really care that high quality tickets (e.g., Github issues or Jira tickets) are drafted consistently. Each ticket should capture a requirement defined in a Technical Design Doc (TDD) into a vertical slice of functionality or small, but fundamental, unit of work for an engineer. Non-functional factors and requirements should be considered as well. A well drafted ticket will allow your engineering team to easily understand a requirement and ensure they are building the right thing, at an organization wide scale.

Your first task is to create a template for a ticket, incorporating all best practices for technical engineering leaders. This template should be written in Markdown so that it can be readily consumed by human engineers and AI agents. Your goal is to create a template that allows other engineers to create clear, organized, plain language tickets that capture all information necessary for human engineers to build a logical component of a requirement defined in TDD and PRD documents.

Tell me how you will approach creating this document, then create a framework for evaluating good tickets, draft your tickets template, then evaluate it using your criteria, rating each category on a scale of 1-10. If any category receives a score of less than 8, revise your template until it meets an 8 or above in that criteria.

You are finished when all evaluation criteria show a rating of 8 or above. When you are done, summarize your process in bulleted form, then print the tickets template in markdown format.
